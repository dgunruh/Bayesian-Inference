Description:
A python3 program which is a simple exercise in Bayesian Inference.
It finds the value of e from numbers randomly generated by a
Gaussian distribution, while assuming a uniform prior distribution.
Shown are plots which examine the accuracy as the number of random
samples is increased, and how the resulting Markov chain compares to the 
underlying probability distribution. 

Formatting:
The code is formatted in black.
